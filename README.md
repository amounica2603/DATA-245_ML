For this project we have used Airbnb dataset to perform sentiment analysis of reviews and develop a machine learning model to classify sentiments of the reviews and based on that we have deployed a recommendation system. Recommendation system is based on a recommendation algorithm designed by us, which takes the sentiment score of reviews and several other factors into account. A web page where users can enter their preferences and the output will be recommendations of the top 5 hotels that match their interest.
